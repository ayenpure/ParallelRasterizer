\chapter*{Executive Summary}
A rasterizer that Abishek and I designed. We decided to parallelize it with tbb, openmp, and cilk to compare the differnces beween the two. We focused mostly on the main Rendering function and the scan line algorithm.
We decided on these two parts of the algorithm because of the impact it had on the program when analysizing with a profiler. (see pages below)
